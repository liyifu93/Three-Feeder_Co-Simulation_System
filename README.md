# Three-Feeder_Co-Simulation_System

This distribution network is revised from the real distribution grid of Turin, a city in Northwest of Italy.

Here is the single-line diagram of this system:

Here is the proposed framework for the co-simulation process:

Here is the hardware environment I built in my lab:
