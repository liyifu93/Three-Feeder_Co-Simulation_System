This is the folder under only NOP3 closed scenario.

Hence, 
- DN1 contains bus: MV8, MV9, MV10, MV11, MV12, MV13, MV14.
- DN2 contains bus: MV4, MV5, MV6, MV7, MV15, MV16, MV17, MV18, MV19, MV20, MV21.

I built the DN1 in HIL 402 and DN2 in HIL 604.

For communication network inside the co-simulation system:
- DN1 IP: 192.168.0.101
- DN2 IP: 192.168.0.103

 Inside the DN1 and DN2 folder, the "ThreeFeeder.jpg" file is used as the background image in HIL SCADA. You will need to redirect the path of this image when you run the `.cus file`.
