This is the folder for Typhoon HIL API codes.

I run the Typhoon HIL API on VScode by Python language.

You need to install the [Typhoon-HIL-API](https://pypi.org/project/Typhoon-HIL-API/) first.

More details about Typhoon HIL API: [Typhoon APIâ€™s documentation](https://www.typhoon-hil.com/documentation/typhoon-hil-api-documentation/typhoon_api.html).
